US_Census_Income

1.  The load_data.py script in the src folder loads the dataset, which is saved in census_data.csv in the data folder.

2. Predict whether a US adult has an income of more than $50,000 or not based
on the following features:

- age
- work class
- education level
- marital status
- occupation type
- relationship
- race
- sex
- capital gain
- capital loss
- hours worked per week
- native country

This is a predictive question.

3.  Classify the examples using the Python scikit-learn package's decision tree.

4.  We can summarize the decision tree's accuracy in an accuracy score.
    We can visualize the accuracy of the prediction based on the features.
